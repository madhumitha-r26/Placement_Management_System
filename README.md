# Placement Management System
## Fresher's Target

This study aims to identify the number of freshers who are seeking jobs through off-campus placements in various domains. Here, this project allows them to apply for a job without any prior experience. A website will be created for this project with the main motive of helping freshers get placed in off-campus placements. This website will be created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL languages. With the help of this website, they can register and apply for the jobs of their interested domain. 

The design of the website will be created using HTML and CSS language and the work will be done using PHP language. The tabs that are to be added to the website are Home, login, and register. The home tab will be the default tab on the website that contains the introduction of recruiters, testimonials, and the domains available. The login page contains two buttons for the user and admin that have separate login forms. The registration page contains the registration form in which the user or fresher can create an account on the website.

The functional modules that are used in the website are the registration process, login process, add company, feedback, edit user details, edit job details, delete account, and forgot password. The registration process is used only by the fresher. The freshers are the users who can register by entering all their details on the website. The login process is used by both the user and the admin. The forgot password is implemented only in the user login form which can help the user to change their password. They can log into the website to view and apply for the job openings of their domains. They can also edit their account details, change passwords, send feedback or queries to the admin, and delete their account. The admin can log into the website to add new openings for each domain and to view the freshers registered and applied for recent openings. The admin can also modify or delete the job from the job listings and can view the feedback or queries from the users. The main disadvantage of this project is that the website is not responsive.
