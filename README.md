# Placement Management System
This study aims to identify the number of freshers who are seeking jobs through off-campus placements in various domains. Here, this project allows them to apply for a job without any prior experience. A website will be created for this project with the main motive of helping freshers get placed in off-campus placements. This website will be created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL languages. With the help of this website, they can register and apply for the jobs of their interested domain.
The design of the website will be created using HTML and CSS language and the work will be done using PHP language. The tabs that are to be added to the website are Home, login, and register. The home tab will be the default tab on the website that contains the introduction of recruiters, testimonials, and a count of freshers placed.
The functional modules that are used in the website are the registration process and login process. The registration process is used only by the fresher. The freshers can register by entering all their details on the website. The login process is used in both fresher and admin. The fresher can log into the website to view and apply for the job openings of their domains. The admin can log into the website to add new openings for each domain and to view the freshers registered and applied for recent openings.
